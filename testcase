Based on the additional log you've provided, I can see an important error related to customer type restrictions. Let me provide clarification on this point.

## Clarification on Customer Type Restrictions

Looking at the log and previous code, I can identify that:

1. **Error in the Log**:
   ```
   "logLevel": "ERROR", "additionalInfo": " (EVENT FAILURE Anonymous: null@unknown - /BMOAPI/com.bmo.channels.api.authentication.helper.AuthenticationServiceHelper] Class: AuthenticationServiceHelperMethod: isBinMatchFound, Event: FBC number entered falls in rejected bin range: 6"
   ```

2. **Customer Type Restriction in Code**:
   ```java
   @Value ("$(api.bank.allowed.customertypes) *)
   private String[] customerTypes;
   
   public boolean checkCustomerType(String customerType, String detailsToLog, String deviceTokenCookie) {
       boolean validType = false;
       
       for (String custType : customerTypes) {
           if (customerType.equalsIgnoreCase(custType)) {
               validType = true;
               break;
           }
       }
       
       if (!validType) {
           logger.error("|Authentication Rejected, Reason: customerType not supported. |" + detailsToLog + "|");
           throw new AuthenticationException(
                   ErrorCodeDTO._606.toString(),
                   MapperUtils.getErrorMessage(errorCodeMappingString, ErrorCodeDTO._606.toString()),
                   deviceTokenCookie
           );
       }
       
       return validType;
   }
   ```

3. **Configuration Setting**:
   As you mentioned, the configuration has `api.bank.allowed.customerTypes=O` where "O" appears to represent "Organizations" or small business customers.

## Clarification Summary

1. **Customer Type Restriction**:
   - The current implementation is configured to only allow Organization/Business customers (customerType = "O")
   - Retail customers would be rejected by the `checkCustomerType` method with error code 606
   - This is separate from the temporary password handling logic

2. **BIN Range Validation Error**:
   - The error in the log shows a rejection based on BIN (Bank Identification Number) range
   - The error occurs in method `isBinMatchFound` with the message "FBC number entered falls in rejected bin range: 6"
   - This suggests the card number's BIN prefix is not in the allowed ranges for this authentication service

3. **Temporary Password Flow with Customer Type Restrictions**:
   - The temporary password flow would still work as previously described
   - However, it would only process requests for allowed customer types (currently only "O")
   - Retail customers would be rejected before the temporary password check occurs

This confirms that the authentication service is currently restricted to business/organization customers, and appears to be rejecting certain card BIN ranges that don't match the allowed configurations.

The temporary password flow remains independent of regular password authentication, but both are subject to the customer type restrictions configured in the system.
