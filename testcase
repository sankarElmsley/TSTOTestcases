I have been able to manage and incorporate the CIAM-related changes made by PBB into the Open Banking project. Over the past five days, additional updates have been implemented by VME/PBB, which I will start integrating from today.
Below are the code commits representing the changes I’ve completed so far.

As of now, no other channel services support both debit card and commercial credit flows. This was confirmed during the last SA walkthrough. I am currently preparing documentation of the existing flow, which may help both the BA and SA assess whether further changes are needed to support CIAM.

Additionally, I’m working on a gap analysis of the error codes between the existing and updated flows. This requires more time, as I am still performing reverse engineering by analyzing the codebase.

I will initiate discussions to promote my completed changes to the SIT4 environment.

The consent-related changes are still unclear. A detailed walkthrough is needed to address this. Otherwise, I may need to perform a similar reverse engineering exercise as I’m currently doing for the authentication API.
