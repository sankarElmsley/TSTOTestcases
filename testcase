We definitely need to focus more on the following three areas. I’ll aim to complete as much of the existing code work as possible this week and begin the process to promote the changes:

Assess whether any additional changes are required for supporting both debit and commercial credit card flows.

Refine the story for the consent flow to ensure clarity and alignment.

Complete the gap analysis by next week, and upon completion, I’ll seek quick approval from the architect and proceed with implementation.
