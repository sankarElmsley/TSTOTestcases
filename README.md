After analyzing all the logs you've provided, I can now see a complete picture of what's happening. Let me compare the successful authentication flow (SIT2 environment) with the failing one (QA4 environment):

## Detailed Comparison of Authentication Flows

### Successful Flow (SIT2 - from document #4):
1. User submits credentials (card number and password)
2. System validates BIN range successfully
3. System calls `getFinancialSnapshot` API and receives HTTP 200 OK
4. System executes `initialDatabaseValidations` step
5. System calls RSA analyze service (rsaAnalyze endpoint) which returns "VERIFIED" status
6. System retrieves card details from `getCardDetails` API successfully
7. System calls PartyIdentification V5 service to get ECIF ID
8. System calls PartyIdentification V5 service again to get INTUIT ID, which succeeds
9. System proceeds to RSA challenge generation
10. User is presented with a security question
11. User answers the question
12. Authentication completes successfully with HTTP 200 OK

### Failing Flow 1 (QA4 - "Card Not Found"):
1. User submits credentials
2. System fails at database validation with "Card Not Found"
3. System returns error code 601 to the user

### Failing Flow 2 (QA4 - "customerType not supported"):
1. User submits credentials
2. System validates BIN range successfully
3. System calls `getFinancialSnapshot` API and receives HTTP 200 OK
4. System fails with "customerType not supported" in `checkCustomerTypeEvent`
5. System returns error code 606 to the user

## Root Cause Analysis

There are two distinct failure modes in the QA4 environment:

1. **Card Not Found**: This happens when the card number entered isn't recognized at all in the system.

2. **customerType not supported**: This happens when the card is found, but the customer type associated with the account is not supported for authentication in this environment.

When comparing the successful flow with the failing flows, it's apparent that:

1. The QA4 environment has different validation rules or data than the SIT2 environment
2. The specific customer type validation is failing in QA4 but passing in SIT2
3. The flow reaches deeper into the authentication process in SIT2 

## Instructions for Backend Team

Based on this analysis, here's what you should instruct your team to check with the backend team:

1. **Check Customer Type Configuration in QA4**:
   - Verify what customer types are supported/unsupported in QA4 vs. SIT2
   - Examine the `checkCustomerTypeEvent` method in `AuthenticationServiceHelper` class
   - Look for environment-specific configurations that determine valid customer types

2. **Check the Financial Snapshot Response**:
   - The customerType is determined from the financial snapshot response data
   - Compare the responses between environments to see what is different
   - Look for specific customer type indicators that might be triggering the rejection

3. **Review Card Database Configuration**:
   - Verify that the card database in QA4 has the same configuration as SIT2
   - Check if certain card types are intentionally blocked in QA4

4. **Specific API Flow to Investigate**:
   - Focus on the steps after `getFinancialSnapshot` returns successfully but before `checkCustomerTypeEvent` fails
   - This is where the determination of customer type happens
   - The specific validation that rejects the customer type in QA4 should be examined

5. **Configuration Differences**:
   - Compare configuration files between environments that define valid customer types
   - Look for feature flags or environment-specific settings

This is clearly a customer type validation issue rather than a pure technical error. The system is working as designed but rejecting this customer type specifically in the QA4 environment.
